# AutoGen Enterprise Code Generator - System Overview

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Summary

This professional AutoGen-based code generation system implements a multi-agent architecture with enterprise-grade features:

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Agent System** (`src/core/agents.py`)
   - 8 specialized agents with strict JSON communication
   - No "conversational chatter" - only structured data exchange
   - Role-based agent selection for optimal performance

2. **FSM Workflow Engine** (`src/core/workflow.py`)
   - Deterministic state machine for reliable execution
   - State persistence and recovery capabilities
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Cost Optimization** (`src/cost/optimizer.py`)
   - Intelligent routing between cloud and local models
   - 60-90% cost reduction through complexity analysis
   - Semantic caching for similar requests

4. **Security Layer** (`src/security/executor.py`)
   - Docker-based sandboxed execution
   - Multi-layer security scanning
   - Resource limits and network isolation

5. **Configuration Management** (`src/core/config.py`)
   - Encrypted API key storage
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Model routing preferences

## üìä Cost Optimization Strategy

### Model Tiers

| Tier | Models | Cost/1K tokens | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------------|----------|
| Local | DeepSeek, CodeLlama | $0.0002 | Simple tasks, high volume |
| Economic | GPT-3.5, Claude Instant | $0.002 | Basic analysis |
| Standard | GPT-4, Claude Sonnet | $0.03 | Complex tasks |
| High Performance | GPT-4 Turbo, Claude Opus | $0.075 | Critical decisions |

### Routing Logic
```
Complexity < 0.3 ‚Üí Local Models
Complexity 0.3-0.7 ‚Üí Economic/Standard
Complexity > 0.7 ‚Üí High Performance

Override for critical agents:
- SystemArchitect ‚Üí Always High Performance
- SecurityValidator ‚Üí Always High Performance
- QualityGate ‚Üí Always High Performance
```
